## Overview

This package contains the functions needed to create various features in R using the Defra Farming Stats Team templates. Including scripts, projects, README and gitignores. It also contains useful functions for linking RStudio and RStudio projects to GitHub.

## Installing `fssetup`

``` r
devtools::install_github("jpmoatt/fssetup",
                         auth_token = "PAT",
```

Alternatively, you can download a .zip copy of this repo and install it using this:

``` r
install.packages("~/Downloads/fssetup.zip",
                 repos = NULL)
```

## Features

The aim of the `fssetup` package is to standardise how we use R and encourage the use of coding best practice across Farming Stats. Below is a brief description of the key features and functions within the package and how to use them. More details can be found in the accompanying package material.

### Projects

R projects should be the default way of working for any work undertaken in R. To standardise how we set out and use projects, this package `fssetup` will install a package template into your RStudio IDE. You can access this through the new project window in RStudio by going to File -\> New Project... Alternatively, you can access the new project window through the projects dropdown at the top right of the RStudio window.

#### The project template

A project created using this template will have the skeleton of a R project for you. The template looks like this:

-   **01_data folder** - this is where you should store your data (unless it is stored securely elsewhere).

-   **02_src** - this is where any material you source in (e.g. scripts, functions, rmds, etc) should be stored.

-   **03_outputs** - where any outputs should be saved to (e.g. svgs, ods, text files, etc)

-   **README** - two files for your README will be added, a quarto (.qmd) file where you can create your README, and the output of your README. This will either be a .html or .md file depending on what option you choose (see below).

-   **pipeline** - if selected in the options (see below) and initial pipeline script will be added, this should be the master script which executes your project. You can source all other material (scripts, rmds etc) into this script to be executed.

#### Starting a new project

1.  Go to File -\> New Project...
2.  The new project window should open, here select "New Directory":

4.  The next pane will ask for some details. Fill in the details (see below) and then click "Create Project".\
    \
    The details required are:
    -   Directory name - this will be the project and folder name. This should follow best practice (e.g. "my_new_project" or "my-new-project").

    -   Create project as a subdirectory of - use this to specify where the project should be saved.

    -   README title - the title for your README. If blank, this will be auto-populated.

    -   Author - your name or initials.

    -   Include pipe script - this will include an initial R script within the directory using the `fssetup` script template (see below).

    -   README output format - what format your README will take. Default is HTML but can also be GitHub or markdown.

5.  Once you click create project, the new project will be created using the Farming Stats template and RStudio will change to this project.
