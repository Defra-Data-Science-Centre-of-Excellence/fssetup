#' @description Connect RStudio to your GitHub account using SSH - this is the
#'   preferred method of connecting RStudio and GitHub on the DASH platform. The
#'   use will only need to supply their GitHub username and email address, then
#'   the function will set their credentials and generate an SSH key. Once the
#'   SSH key has been added to GitHub, the function does the final bits of
#'   set-up. All steps and outputs are printed in the RStudio console rather
#'   than the terminal, which offers a more user friendly experience.
#'
#' @details The suggested method for connecting RStudio and GitHub on the DASH
#'   platform is via SSH. The alternative is via Personal Access Token, but this
#'   method can be a bit clunky and frustrating on the DASH platform. With SSH
#'   providing a much smoother user experience.
#'
#'   This function is designed to simplify the connection process and avoid the
#'   user having to interact with the terminal - which many beginners to Git
#'   find intimidating. Instead, all prompts and outputs are returned in the
#'   RStudio console.
#'
#'   The users calls the function and gives their user credentials (username and
#'   email), the function will set these and print an output to confirm they
#'   have been set. The function will then create a hidden SSH folder and
#'   sub-folder for "id_ed25519" (~/.ssh/id_ed25519). Once done, it will then
#'   generate your SSH key and save it to this folder. The SSH key will then be
#'   printed in the console. The function then adds GitHub as a known host.
#'
#'   At this point, the function pauses and asks the user to confirm they have
#'   added the SSH key to GitHub. The user can then copy the SSH key from the
#'   console, got to GitHub -> settings -> SSH and GPG keys and add the SSH key.
#'
#'   Once added, the user can respond to the prompt and the function will finish
#'   establishing the connection. If all works as expected, the message "Hi
#'   username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide
#'   shell access" will be printed in the console.
#'
#' @param username user's GitHub username
#'
#' @param email user's email address
